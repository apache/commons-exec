                Applied the patch from Nickolay Martinov but the timeout disguises the fact
                that the process might be still running. Therefore added a sanity check in

                Fixed deadlock by calling the timeout observers outside of the synchronized block thereby
                removing a prerequisite of a deadlock. Also added a test case to demonstrate that this
                problem is fixed (which of course can not guarantee the absence of a dead lock).

                desperate because it could leave up to three worker threads behind but there
                might be situations where this is the only escape.

                Because the ExecuteWatchdog is the only way to destroy asynchronous processes,
