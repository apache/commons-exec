        Fixes NPE in DefaultExecutor.setExitValues().
      </action>

        Copies all data from an System.input stream to an output stream of 
        the executed process.

    <release version="1.0" date="2009-03-15" description="First Public Release">
      <action dev="sgoeschl" type="fix" due-to="Sebastien Bazley" issue="EXEC-37">
        Removed useless synchronized statement in
        OpenVmsProcessingEnvironment.createProcEnvironment
      </action>
      <action dev="sgoeschl" type="fix" issue="EXEC-33">
        Using System.in for child process will actually hang your application -
        see JIRA for more details. Since there is no easy fix an
        IllegalRuntimeException is thrown when System.in is passed.
      </action>
      <action dev="sgoeschl" type="fix" due-to="Luc Maisonobe" issue="EXEC-35">
        Fixing a few findbugs issues.
      </action>
      <action dev="sgoeschl" type="fix" due-to="Marco Ferrante" issue="EXEC-32">
        Handle null streams consistently.
      </action>
      <action dev="sgoeschl" type="fix">
        After a long discussion we decided to stick to following groupId
        "org.apache.commons" instead of "commons-exec".
      </action>
      <action dev="sgoeschl" type="fix" due-to="Kevin Jackson">
        The Ant build now works even when junit is not on the classpath
      </action>
      <action dev="sgoeschl" type="fix">
        Fixed broken "groupId" from "org.apache.commons" to "commons-exec"
      </action>
      <action dev="sgoeschl" type="fix" issue="EXEC-27" due-to="Benjamin Bentmann">
        Renamed EnvironmentUtil to EnvironmentUtils to align with other classes
        in this project and commons in general. Please note that this change
        could break existing clients (but would be rather unlikely).
      </action>
      <action dev="sgoeschl" type="fix" issue="EXEC-30" due-to="Benjamin Bentmann">
         Make environment variables respect casing rules of platforms. Under Windows
         "PATH", "Path" and "path" would access the same environment variable whereas
         the real name is "Path".
      </action>
      <action dev="sgoeschl" type="fix" issue="EXEC-31" due-to="Benjamin Bentmann">
        Invoking DefaultExecutor.execute(CommandLine command, Map environment) using 
        a 'null' Map results in inheriting all environment variables of the current
        process while passing an empty map implies starting the new process with no
        environment variables. In short 'null' is not the same as an empty map. 
      </action>
      <action dev="sgoeschl" type="add" issue="EXEC-26" due-to="Benjamin Bentmann">
        Added one additional test : DefaultExecutorTest.testExecuteWithFancyArg
      </action>
      <action dev="sgoeschl" issue="EXEC-25" type="fix">
        Using variable substitution within CommandLine broke the regression tests
        under Windows. Found also another bug when calling CommandLine.getExecutable()
        the result was not substituted at all. As a general rule we do variable
        substitution and file separator fixing on the command line executable and
        variable substitution but NO file separator fixing for the command line
        arguments.
      </action>
      <action dev="sgoeschl" type="add">
        Added convinience method to add two parameters to the CommandLine
        using one method invocation.
      </action>
      <action dev="sgoeschl" type="fix">
        Implemented better regression test for OpenVMS affecting also
        the Executor and CommandLauncher interface.
      </action>
      <action dev="sebb" type="add">
        Added test scripts for OpenVMS - he seems to be the last human
        having access to an OpenVMS box ... :-)
      </action>
      <action dev="sgoeschl" type="add" due-to="Simone Gianni,Bindul Bhowmik,Niall Pemberton,Sebastian Bazley">
        With the help of the Apache Commons community I added the first results
        of cross-OS testing.
      </action>
      <action dev="sgoeschl" type="add">
        The regression tests now also works on Windows - so it should
        work now on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X
      </action>
      <action dev="sgoeschl" type="add">
        Added DebugUtils to improve cross-platform testing.
      </action>
      <action dev="sgoeschl" type="remove">
        Removed commons-logging integration
      </action>
      <action dev="sgoeschl" type="add" issue="SANDBOX-62" due-to="Jeremy Lacoste">
        Made DefaultExecutor.launch() protected to enable mocking.
      </action>
      <action dev="sgoeschl" type="add" issue="SANDBOX-107" due-to="Niklas Gustavsson">
        Made ProcessDestroyer optional and pluggable when using Executor.
      </action>
      <action dev="sgoeschl" type="add">
        CommandLine can now expand the given command line by a user-suppied
        map. This allows to execute something like "${JAVA_HOME}/bin/java -jar ${myapp}"
      </action>
      <action dev="sgoeschl" type="add" issue="SANDBOX-192" due-to="Reinhold Fuereder">
        Added methods to provide pre-quoted arguments.

        Exposing a ExecuteWatchdog.destroy() to kill an asynchrounous process
        manually. This formalizes a workaround described in the JIRA
